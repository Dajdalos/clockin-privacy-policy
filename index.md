# Privacy Policy for ClockIn

**Last Updated: November 16, 2024**

## Introduction

ClockIn ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how ClockIn handles your data.

## Data Collection

**ClockIn does NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal data.**

The app stores the following information **locally on your device only**:
- Work hours entries (date, hours worked, client/project name, notes)
- Hourly rate settings
- Currency symbol preference

**This data never leaves your device.**

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using Android's Room Database. We:
- ✅ Do NOT have access to your data
- ✅ Do NOT transmit data to any servers
- ✅ Do NOT use cloud storage
- ✅ Do NOT track your usage
- ✅ Do NOT use analytics tools

## Permissions

ClockIn requests only one permission:

### VIBRATE Permission
- **Purpose:** Provides haptic feedback when you interact with the app (save, delete, navigate)
- **Usage:** Only used for tactile feedback on your device
- **Data Access:** Does NOT access any personal information

## Third-Party Services

ClockIn does NOT use any third-party services, including:
- ❌ No analytics (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
- ❌ No advertising networks
- ❌ No crash reporting services
- ❌ No social media integrations
- ❌ No cloud services

## Data Backup

ClockIn uses Android's built-in backup system (`allowBackup="true"`):
- Your data may be backed up to your Google Account as part of Android's automatic backup
- This is controlled by your device's backup settings (Settings → Google → Backup)
- We do not have access to these backups
- You can disable this in your Android settings

## Data Deletion

Your data can be deleted by:
1. **Uninstalling the app** - Removes all data permanently
2. **Clearing app data** - Settings → Apps → ClockIn → Storage → Clear Data
3. **Deleting individual entries** - Within the app using the delete function

Once deleted, data **cannot be recovered** as we do not store any backups.

## Children's Privacy

ClockIn does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13. The app can be used by anyone, and all data stays on the device.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- Your device's security features (lock screen, encryption) protect your data
- We recommend enabling device encryption and using a secure lock screen
- We do not transmit data, so there is no risk of interception

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## International Users

ClockIn is available worldwide and operates the same way in all countries:
- All data stays on your device
- No data transfers across borders
- Complies with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations by design (no data collection = no privacy risk)

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect your data, there is no data for us to:
- Access
- Modify
- Delete
- Export
- Share

You have complete control over your data through your device.
